## How to run demo 11/23
### Requirements
You'll need python3, pip, and Flask

I followed this tutorial for pip: https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-pip-mac
For python3: https://realpython.com/installing-python/
For flask: You can run 'pip install Flask' in your terminal once you installed pip

### Running it
After downlaoding the requirements, locate to the "project" folder on your terminal. Type in:
```
python3 app.py
```
It should say that the debugger is active. You can then open localhost:3000 to see the webpage!
You can test out the form by inputting anything and then clicking predict. It should then relay your response. Next steps would be to connect to the models.
