## How to Run Demo
### Requirements
You will need to have python3, pip, and Flask installed.

I followed this tutorial for installing pip: https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-pip-mac
For installing python3: https://realpython.com/installing-python/
For installing flask: You can run 
```
pip install Flask
```
in your terminal once you installed pip.

### Running it
After downlaoding the requirements, locate to "project" folder on your terminal. 
Type in:
```
python3 app.py
```
It should say that the debugger is active. On your web browser, you can then type in and navigate to 
```
localhost:3000
```
to use our demo!
