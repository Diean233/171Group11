**11/24**  
Caitlin Brown: consolidate all linear and poly models into one notebook for ease of interpretation

**11/23**  
McKenzie Hochberg: updated hyperparameter turning to LSTM.ipynb to show results of tuned hyperparameters  
Alvin Agana: added Python Flask app for demo and added form input. Included how to run app in readme
